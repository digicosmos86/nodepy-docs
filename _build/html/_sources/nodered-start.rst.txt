Setting up Node-RED
===================

If you are using our custom image, please skip the section below. Node-RED is already set up on your Raspberry Pi.

Setting up Node-RED on Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------

The easiest way to set up Node-RED on your Raspberry Pi is to use this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/raspbian-deb-package/master/resources/update-nodejs-and-nodered)

You will also need to install some useful nodes as well:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo npm install -g node-red-dashboard
   $ sudo npm install -g node-red-contrib-python3-function
   $ sudo npm install -g node-red-contrib-web-worldmap

Setting up Node-RED on a Server
-------------------------------

The benefit of running Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi is that you can create flows that control the SenseHAT.  However, sometimes it is easier to have it run on a server.  To do this, you need to, first, make sure you have node.js set up on the server.  You can use this command to check:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ node --version

If you are running node.js version 6.x and above, you are ready to install Node-RED.  Otherwise, go to `the official node.js download page <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_ to install the LTS version.

npm will be automatically installed with node.js.  On Linux systems, you can run the following command to install Node-RED.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ sudo npm install -g node-red
   $ sudo npm install -g node-red-dashboard
   $ sudo npm install -g node-red-contrib-python3-function
   $ sudo npm install -g node-red-contrib-web-worldmap

On Windows systems, you can start a command line window with administrative privileges: Start Menu -> Windows System -> right click on Command Line and select run as administrator.  Then, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ npm install -g node-red
   $ npm install -g node-red-dashboard
   $ npm install -g node-red-contrib-python3-function
   $ npm install -g node-red-contrib-web-worldmap

Setting Up Node-RED on the Cloud
--------------------------------

There are also benefits running Node-RED on a Cloud Platform.  The Node-RED official websites have exellent instructions on setting up Node-RED on different cloud platforms.  We recommend that you use the IBM Bluemix platform since IBM has better support for Node-RED.
